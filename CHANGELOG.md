# Change Log

## Upcoming Release 2.0.0

This major release of Tianshou is a big step towards cleaner design and improved usability.

Given the large extent of the changes, it was not possible to maintain compatibility with the previous version.
  * Persisted agents that were created with earlier versions cannot be loaded in v2.
  * Source code from v1 can, however, be migrated to v2 with minimal effort.  
    See migration information below. For concrete examples, you may use git to diff individual 
    example scripts with the corresponding ones in `v1.2.0`.

This release is brought to you by [Applied AI Institute gGmbH](https://www.appliedai-institute.de).  

Developers:
  * Dr. Dominik Jain (@opcode81)
  * Michael Panchenko (@MischaPanch)  

### Trainer Abstraction

* The trainer logic and configuration is now properly separated between the three cases of on-policy, off-policy
  and offline learning: The base class is no longer a "God" class (formerly `BaseTrainer`) which does it all; logic and functionality has moved
  to the respective subclasses (`OnPolicyTrainer`, `OffPolicyTrainer` and `OfflineTrainer`, with `OnlineTrainer`
  being introduced as a base class for the two former specialisations).
* The trainers now use configuration objects with central documentation (which has been greatly improved to enhance
  clarity and usability in general); every type of trainer now has a dedicated configuration class which provides
  precisely the options that are applicable.
* The interface has been streamlined with improved naming of functions/parameters and limiting the public interface to purely
  the methods and attributes a user should reasonably access.
* Further changes potentially affecting usage:
    * We dropped the iterator semantics: Method `__next__` has been replaced by `execute_epoch`. #913
    * We no longer report outdated statistics (e.g. on rewards/returns when a training step does not collect any full
      episodes)
    * See also "Issues resolved" below (as issue resolution can result in usage changes) 
    * The default value for `test_in_train` was changed from True to False (updating all usage sites to explicitly
      set the parameter), because False is the more natural default, which does not make assumptions about
      returns/score values computed for the data from a collection step being at all meaningful for early stopping
    * The management of episolon-greedy exploration for discrete Q-learning algorithms has been simplified:
        * All respective Policy implementations (e.g. `DQNPolicy`, `C51Policy`, etc.) now accept two parameters
          `eps_training` and `eps_inference`, which allows the training and test collection cases to be sufficiently
          differentiated and makes the use of callback functions (`train_fn`, `test_fn`) unnecessary if only
          constants are to be set.
        * The setter method `set_eps` has been replaced with `set_eps_training` and `set_eps_inference` accordingly.
* Further internal changes unlikely to affect usage:
    * Module `trainer.utils` was removed and the functions therein where moved to class `Trainer`
    * The two places that collected and evaluated test episodes (`_test_in_train` and `_reset`) in addition to 
      `_test_step` were unified to use `_test_step` (with some minor parametrisation) and now log the results 
      of the test step accordingly.
* Issues resolved:
    * Methods `run` and `reset`: Parameter `reset_prior_to_run` of `run` was never respected if it was set to `False`,
      because the implementation of `__iter__` (now removed) would call `reset` regardless - and calling `reset`
      is indeed necessary, because it initializes the training. The parameter was removed and replaced by
      `reset_collectors` (such that `run` now replicates the parameters of `reset`).
    * Inconsistent configuration options now raise exceptions rather than silently ignoring the issue in the 
      hope that default behaviour will achieve what the user intended.
      One condition where `test_in_train` was silently set to `False` was removed and replaced by a warning.
    * The stop criterion `stop_fn` did not consider scores as computed by `compute_score_fn` but instead always used
      mean returns (i.e. it was assumed that the default implementation of `compute_score_fn` applies).
      This is an inconsistency which has been resolved.
    * The `gradient_step` counter was flawed (as it made assumptions about the underlying algorithms, which were 
      not valid). It has been replaced with an update step counter.
      Members of `InfoStats` and parameters of `Logger` (and subclasses) were changed accordingly. 
* Migration information at a glance:
    * Training parameters are now passed via instances of configuration objects instead of directly as keyword arguments:
      `OnPolicyTrainerParams`, `OffPolicyTrainerParams`, `OfflineTrainerParams`.
        * Changed parameter default: Default for `test_in_train` was changed from True to False.
        * Changed parameter names to improve clarity:
            * `max_epoch` (`num_epochs` in high-level API) -> `max_epochs`
            * `step_per_epoch` -> `epoch_num_steps`
            * `episode_per_test` (`num_test_episodes` in high-level API) -> `test_step_num_episodes`
            * `step_per_collect` -> `collection_step_num_env_steps`
            * `episode_per_collect` ->  collection_step_num_episodes`
            * `update_per_step` -> `update_step_num_gradient_steps_per_sample`
            * `repeat_per_collect` -> `update_step_num_repetitions`
    * Trainer classes have been renamed:
        * `OnpolicyTrainer` -> `OnPolicyTrainer`
        * `OffpolicyTrainer` -> `OffPolicyTrainer`
    * Method `run`: The parameter `reset_prior_to_run` was removed and replaced by `reset_collectors` (see above).
    * Methods `run` and `reset`: The parameter `reset_buffer` was renamed to `reset_collector_buffers` for clarity
    * Trainers are no longer iterators; manual usage (not using `run`) should simply call `reset` followed by
      calls of `execute_epoch`.

### Algorithms and Policies

* We now conceptually differentiate between the learning algorithm and the policy being optimised:
  * The abstraction `BasePolicy` is thus replaced by `Algorithm` and `Policy`, and the package was renamed 
    from `tianshou.policy` to `tianshou.algorithm`.
  * Migration information: The instantiation of a policy is replaced by the instantiation of an `Algorithm`,
    which is passed a `Policy`. In most cases, the former policy class name `<Name>Policy` is replaced by algorithm
    class `<Name>`; exceptions are noted below.
      * `ImitationPolicy` -> `OffPolicyImitationLearning`, `OfflineImitationLearning` 
      * `PGPolicy` -> `Reinforce` 
      * `MultiAgentPolicyManager` -> `MultiAgentOnPolicyAlgorithm`, `MultiAgentOffPolicyAlgorithm` 
      * `MARLRandomPolicy` -> `MARLRandomDiscreteMaskedOffPolicyAlgorithm`
    For the respective subtype of `Policy` to use, see the respective algorithm class' constructor.
* Interface changes/improvements:
    * Core methods have been renamed (and removed from the public interface; #898):
        * `process_fn` -> `_preprocess_batch`
        * `post_process_fn` -> `_postprocess_batch`
        * `learn` -> `_update_with_batch`
    * The updating interface has been cleaned up (#949):
        * Functions `update` and `_update_with_batch` (formerly `learn`) no longer have `*args` and `**kwargs`.
        * Instead, the interfaces for the offline, off-policy and on-policy cases are properly differentiated.
    * New method `run_training`: The `Algorithm` abstraction can now directly initiate the learning process via this method.
    * `Algorithms` no longer require `torch.optim.Optimizer` instances and instead require `OptimizerFactory` 
      instances, which create the actual optimizers internally. #959
      The new `OptimizerFactory` abstraction simultaneously handles the creation of learning rate schedulers
      for the optimizers created (via method `with_lr_scheduler_factory` and accompanying factory abstraction 
      `LRSchedulerFactory`).
      The parameter `lr_scheduler` has thus been removed from all algorithm constructors.
    * The flag `updating` has been removed (no internal usage, general usefulness questionable).
    * Removed `max_action_num`, instead read it off from `action_space`
    * Parameter changes:
        * `actor_step_size` -> `trust_region_size` in NP
        * `discount_factor` -> `gamma` (was already used internally almost everywhere) 
        * `reward_normalization` -> `return_standardization` or `return_scaling` (more precise naming) or removed (was actually unsupported by Q-learning algorithms)
            * `return_standardization` in `Reinforce` and `DiscreteCRR` (as it applies standardization of returns)
            * `return_scaling` in actor-critic on-policy algorithms (A2C, PPO, GAIL, NPG, TRPO)
            * removed from Q-learning algorithms, where it was actually unsupported (DQN, C561, etc.)
        * `clip_grad` -> `max_grad_norm` (for consistency)
        * `clip_loss_grad` -> `huber_loss_delta` (allowing to control not only the use of the Huber loss but also its essential parameter)
        * `estimation_step` -> `n_step_return_horizon` (more precise naming)
* Internal design improvements:
    * Introduced an abstraction for the alpha parameter (coefficient of the entropy term) 
      in `SAC`, `DiscreteSAC` and other algorithms.
        * Class hierarchy:
            * Abstract base class `Alpha` base class with value property and update method
            * `FixedAlpha` for constant entropy coefficients
            * `AutoAlpha` for automatic entropy tuning (replaces the old tuple-based representation)
        * The (auto-)updating logic is now completely encapsulated, reducing the complexity of the algorithms.
        * Implementations for continuous and discrete cases now share the same abstraction,
          making the codebase more consistent while preserving the original functionality.
    * Introduced a policy base class `ContinuousPolicyWithExplorationNoise` which encapsulates noise generation 
      for continuous action spaces (e.g. relevant to `DDPG`, `SAC` and `REDQ`). 
    * Multi-agent RL methods are now differentiated by the type of the sub-algorithms being employed
      (`MultiAgentOnPolicyAlgorithm`, `MultiAgentOffPolicyAlgorithm`), which renders all interfaces clean.
      Helper class `MARLDispatcher` has been factored out to manage the dispatching of data to the respective agents.
    * Algorithms now internally use a wrapper (`Algorithm.Optimizer`) around the optimizers; creation is handled
      by method `_create_optimizer`. 
        * This facilitates backpropagation steps with gradient clipping.  
        * The optimizers of an Algorithm instance are now centrally tracked, such that we can ensure that the 
          optimizers' states are handled alongside the model parameters when calling `state_dict` or `load_state_dict` 
          on the `Algorithm` instance.
          Special handling of the restoration of optimizers' state dicts was thus removed from examples and tests.
* Fixed issues in the class hierarchy (particularly critical violations of the Liskov substitution principle): 
    * Introduced base classes (to retain factorization without abusive inheritance):
        * `ActorCriticOnPolicyAlgorithm`
        * `ActorCriticOffPolicyAlgorithm`
        * `ActorDualCriticsOffPolicyAlgorithm` (extends `ActorCriticOffPolicyAlgorithm`)
        * `QLearningOffPolicyAlgorithm`
    * `A2C`: Inherit from `ActorCriticOnPolicyAlgorithm` instead of `Reinforce`
    * `BDQN`:
        * Inherit from `QLearningOffPolicyAlgorithm` instead of `DQN`
        * Remove parameter `clip_loss_grad` (unused; only passed on to former base class)
        * Remove parameter `estimation_step`, for which only one option was valid 
    * `C51`:
        * Inherit from `QLearningOffPolicyAlgorithm` instead of `DQN`
        * Remove parameters `clip_loss_grad` and `is_double` (unused; only passed on to former base class)
    * `CQL`:
        * Inherit directly from `OfflineAlgorithm` instead of `SAC` (off-policy).
        * Remove parameter `estimation_step` (now `n_step_return_horizon`), which was not actually used (it was only passed it on to its
          superclass).
    * `DiscreteBCQ`: 
        * Inherit directly from `OfflineAlgorithm` instead of `DQN`
        * Remove unused parameters `clip_loss_grad` and `is_double`, which were only passed on to
          former the base class but actually unused. 
    * `DiscreteCQL`: Remove unused parameters `clip_loss_grad` and `is_double`, which were only passed on to
      base class `QRDQN` (and unused by it).
    * `DiscreteCRR`: Inherit directly from `OfflineAlgorithm` instead of `Reinforce` (on-policy)
    * `FQF`: Remove unused parameters `clip_loss_grad` and `is_double`, which were only passed on to
      base class `QRDQN` (and unused by it).
    * `IQN`: Remove unused parameters `clip_loss_grad` and `is_double`, which were only passed on to 
      base class `QRDQN` (and unused by it).
    * `NPG`: Inherit from `ActorCriticOnPolicyAlgorithm` instead of `A2C`
    * `QRDQN`: 
        * Inherit from `QLearningOffPolicyAlgorithm` instead of `DQN`
        * Remove parameters `clip_loss_grad` and `is_double` (unused; only passed on to former base class) 
    * `REDQ`: Inherit from `ActorCriticOffPolicyAlgorithm` instead of `DDPG`
    * `SAC`: Inherit from `ActorDualCriticsOffPolicyAlgorithm` instead of `DDPG`
    * `TD3`: Inherit from `ActorDualCriticsOffPolicyAlgorithm` instead of `DDPG`

### High-Level API

* Detailed optimizer configuration (analogous to the procedural API) is now possible:
    * All optimizers can be configured in the respective algorithm-specific `Params` object by using
      `OptimizerFactoryFactory` instances as parameter values (e.g. `optim`, `actor_optim`, `critic_optim`, etc.).
    * Learning rate schedulers remain separate parameters and now use `LRSchedulerFactoryFactory` 
      instances. The respective parameter names now use the suffix `lr_scheduler` instead of `lr_scheduler_factory`
      (as the precise nature need not be reflected in the name; brevity is preferable).
* `SamplingConfig` is replaced by `TrainingConfig` and subclasses differentiating off-policy and on-policy cases 
  appropriately (`OnPolicyTrainingConfig`, `OffPolicyTrainingConfig`).
    * The `test_in_train` parameter is now exposed (default False).
    * Inapplicable arguments can no longer be set in the respective subclass (e.g. `OffPolicyTrainingConfig` does not
      contain parameter `repeat_per_collect`). 
    * All parameter names have been aligned with the new names used by `TrainerParams` (see above).

### Peripheral Changes

* The `Actor` classes have been renamed for clarity (#1091):
    * `BaseActor` -> `Actor` 
    * `continuous.ActorProb` -> `ContinuousActorProbabilistic`
    * `coninuous.Actor` -> `ContinuousActorDeterministic`
    * `discrete.Actor` -> `DiscreteActor`
* The `Critic` classes have been renamed for clarity (#1091):
    * `continuous.Critic` -> `ContinuousCritic`
    * `discrete.Critic` -> `DiscreteCritic`
* Moved Atari helper modules `atari_network` and `atari_wrapper` to the library under `tianshou.env.atari`.
* Fix issues pertaining to the torch device assignment of network components (#810):
    * Remove 'device' member (and the corresponding constructor argument) from the following classes:
      `BranchingNet`, `C51Net`, `ContinuousActorDeterministic`, `ContinuousActorProbabilistic`, `ContinuousCritic`, 
      `DiscreteActor`, `DiscreteCritic`, `DQNet`, `FullQuantileFunction`, `ImplicitQuantileNetwork`, 
      `IntrinsicCuriosityModule`, `MLPActor`, `MLP`, `Perturbation`, `QRDQNet`, `Rainbow`, `Recurrent`, 
      `RecurrentActorProb`, `RecurrentCritic`, `VAE`
    * (Peripheral change:) Require the use of keyword arguments for the constructors of all of these classes 
* Clean up handling of modules that define attribute `output_dim`, introducing the explicit base class 
  `ModuleWithVectorOutput`
    * Interfaces where one could specify either a module with `output_dim` or additionally provide the output 
      dimension as an argument were changed to use `ModuleWithVectorOutput`.
    * The high-level API class `IntermediateModule` can now provide a `ModuleWithVectorOutput` instance 
      (via adaptation if necessary).
* The class hierarchy of supporting `nn.Module` implementations was cleaned up (#1091):
    * With the fundamental base classes `ActionReprNet` and `ActionReprNetWithVectorOutput`, we etablished a 
      well-defined interface for the most commonly used `forward` interface in Tianshou's algorithms & policies. #948
    * Some network classes were renamed:
        * `ScaledObsInputModule` -> `ScaledObsInputActionReprNet` 
        * `Rainbow` -> `RainbowNet` 
* All modules containing base classes were renamed from `base` to a more descriptive name, rendering
  file names unique.

## Release 1.2.0

### Changes/Improvements

- `trainer`:
    - Custom scoring now supported for selecting the best model. #1202
- `highlevel`:
    - `DiscreteSACExperimentBuilder`: Expose method `with_actor_factory_default` #1248 #1250
    - `ActorFactoryDefault`: Fix parameters for hidden sizes and activation not being 
      passed on in the discrete case (affects `with_actor_factory_default` method of experiment builders)
    - `ExperimentConfig`: Do not inherit from other classes, as this breaks automatic handling by
      `jsonargparse` when the class is used to define interfaces (as in high-level API examples)
    - `AutoAlphaFactoryDefault`: Differentiate discrete and continuous action spaces
      and allow coefficient to be modified, adding an informative docstring
      (previous implementation was reasonable only for continuous action spaces)
        - Adjust usage in `atari_sac_hl` example accordingly.
    - `NPGAgentFactory`, `TRPOAgentFactory`: Fix optimizer instantiation including the actor parameters
      (which was misleadingly suggested in the docstring in the respective policy classes; docstrings were fixed),
      as the actor parameters are intended to be handled via natural gradients internally
- `data`:
    - `ReplayBuffer`: Fix collection of empty episodes being disallowed 
    - Collection was slow due to `isinstance` checks on Protocols and due to Buffer integrity validation. This was solved
      by no longer performing `isinstance` on Protocols and by making the integrity validation disabled by default.
- Tests:
    - We have introduced extensive **determinism tests** which allow to validate whether
      training processes deterministically compute the same results across different development branches.
      This is an important step towards ensuring reproducibility and consistency, which will be 
      instrumental in supporting Tianshou developers in their work, especially in the context of
      algorithm development and evaluation. 
  
### Breaking Changes

- `trainer`:
    - `BaseTrainer.run` and `__iter__`: Resetting was never optional prior to running the trainer,
      yet the recently introduced parameter `reset_prior_to_run` of `run` suggested that it _was_ optional.
      Yet the parameter was ultimately not respected, because `__iter__` would always call `reset(reset_collectors=True, reset_buffer=False)`
      regardless. The parameter was removed; instead, the parameters of `run` now mirror the parameters of `reset`,
      and the implicit `reset` call in `__iter__` was removed.     
      This aligns with upcoming changes in Tianshou v2.0.0.  
        * NOTE: If you have been using a trainer without calling `run` but by directly iterating over it, you
          will need to call `reset` on the trainer explicitly before iterating over the trainer.
        * Using a trainer as an iterator is considered deprecated and support for this will be removed in Tianshou v2.0.0.
- `data`:
    - `InfoStats` has a new non-optional field `best_score` which is used
      for selecting the best model. #1202
- `highlevel`:
    - Change the way in which seeding is handled: The mechanism introduced in v1.1.0 
      was completely revised:
        - The `train_seed` and `test_seed` attributes were removed from `SamplingConfig`.
          Instead, the seeds are derived from the seed defined in `ExperimentConfig`.
        - Seed attributes of `EnvFactory` classes were removed. 
          Instead, seeds are passed to methods of `EnvFactory`.

## Release 1.1.0

**NOTE**: This release introduced (potentially severe) performance regressions in data collection, please switch to a newer release for better performance.

### Highlights

#### Evaluation Package

This release introduces a new package `evaluation` that integrates best
practices for running experiments (seeding test and train environmets) and for
evaluating them using the [rliable](https://github.com/google-research/rliable)
library. This should be especially useful for algorithm developers for comparing
performances and creating meaningful visualizations. **This functionality is
currently in alpha state** and will be further improved in the next releases.
You will need to install tianshou with the extra `eval` to use it.

The creation of multiple experiments with varying random seeds has been greatly
facilitated. Moreover, the `ExpLauncher` interface has been introduced and
implemented with several backends to support the execution of multiple
experiments in parallel.

An example for this using the high-level interfaces can be found
[here](examples/mujoco/mujoco_ppo_hl_multi.py), examples that use low-level
interfaces will follow soon.

#### Improvements in Batch

Apart from that, several important
extensions have been added to internal data structures, most notably to `Batch`.
Batches now implement `__eq__` and can be meaningfully compared. Applying
operations in a nested fashion has been significantly simplified, and checking
for NaNs and dropping them is now possible.

One more notable change is that torch `Distribution` objects are now sliced when
slicing a batch. Previously, when a Batch with say 10 actions and a dist
corresponding to them was sliced to `[:3]`, the `dist` in the result would still
correspond to all 10 actions. Now, the dist is also "sliced" to be the
distribution of the first 3 actions.

A detailed list of changes can be found below.

### Changes/Improvements

- `evaluation`: New package for repeating the same experiment with multiple
  seeds and aggregating the results. #1074 #1141 #1183
- `data`:
    - `Batch`:
        - Add methods `to_dict` and `to_list_of_dicts`. #1063 #1098
        - Add methods `to_numpy_` and `to_torch_`. #1098, #1117
        - Add `__eq__` (semantic equality check). #1098
        - `keys()` deprecated in favor of `get_keys()` (needed to make iteration
          consistent with naming) #1105.
        - Major: new methods for applying functions to values, to check for NaNs
          and drop them, and to set values. #1181
        - Slicing a batch with a torch distribution now also slices the
          distribution. #1181
    - `data.collector`:
        - `Collector`:
            - Introduced `BaseCollector` as a base class for all collectors.
              #1123
            - Add method `close` #1063
            - Method `reset` is now more granular (new flags controlling
              behavior). #1063
        - `CollectStats`: Add convenience
          constructor `with_autogenerated_stats`. #1063
- `trainer`:
    - Trainers can now control whether collectors should be reset prior to
      training. #1063
- `policy`:
    - introduced attribute `in_training_step` that is controlled by the trainer.
      #1123
    - policy automatically set to `eval` mode when collecting and to `train`
      mode when updating. #1123
    - Extended interface of `compute_action` to also support array-like inputs
      #1169
- `highlevel`:
    - `SamplingConfig`:
        - Add support for `batch_size=None`. #1077
        - Add `training_seed` for explicit seeding of training and test
          environments, the `test_seed` is inferred from `training_seed`. #1074
    - `experiment`:
        - `Experiment` now has a `name` attribute, which can be set
          using `ExperimentBuilder.with_name` and
          which determines the default run name and therefore the persistence
          subdirectory.
          It can still be overridden in `Experiment.run()`, the new parameter
          name being `run_name` rather than
          `experiment_name` (although the latter will still be interpreted
          correctly). #1074 #1131
        - Add class `ExperimentCollection` for the convenient execution of
          multiple experiment runs #1131
        - The `World` object, containing all low-level objects needed for
          experimentation,
          can now be extracted from an `Experiment` instance. This enables
          customizing
          the experiment prior to its execution, bridging the low and high-level
          interfaces. #1187
        - `ExperimentBuilder`:
            - Add method `build_seeded_collection` for the sound creation of
              multiple
              experiments with varying random seeds #1131
            - Add method `copy` to facilitate the creation of multiple
              experiments from a single builder #1131
    - `env`:
        - Added new `VectorEnvType` called `SUBPROC_SHARED_MEM_AUTO` and used in
          for Atari and Mujoco venv creation. #1141
- `utils`:
    - `logger`:
        - Loggers can now restore the logged data into python by using the
          new `restore_logged_data` method. #1074
        - Wandb logger extended #1183
    - `net.continuous.Critic`:
        - Add flag `apply_preprocess_net_to_obs_only` to allow the
          preprocessing network to be applied to the observations only (without
          the actions concatenated), which is essential for the case where we
          want
          to reuse the actor's preprocessing network #1128
    - `torch_utils` (new module)
        - Added context managers `torch_train_mode`
          and `policy_within_training_step` #1123
    - `print`
        - `DataclassPPrintMixin` now supports outputting a string, not just
          printing the pretty repr. #1141

### Fixes

- `highlevel`:
    - `CriticFactoryReuseActor`: Enable the Critic
      flag `apply_preprocess_net_to_obs_only` for continuous critics,
      fixing the case where we want to reuse an actor's preprocessing network
      for the critic (affects usages
      of the experiment builder method `with_critic_factory_use_actor` with
      continuous environments) #1128
    - Policy parameter `action_scaling` value `"default"` was not correctly
      transformed to a Boolean value for
      algorithms SAC, DDPG, TD3 and REDQ. The value `"default"` being truthy
      caused action scaling to be enabled
      even for discrete action spaces. #1191
- `atari_network.DQN`:
    - Fix constructor input validation #1128
    - Fix `output_dim` not being set if `features_only`=True
      and `output_dim_added_layer` is not None #1128
- `PPOPolicy`:
    - Fix `max_batchsize` not being used in `logp_old` computation
      inside `process_fn` #1168
- Fix `Batch.__eq__` to allow comparing Batches with scalar array values #1185

### Internal Improvements

- `Collector`s rely less on state, the few stateful things are stored explicitly
  instead of through a `.data` attribute. #1063
- Introduced a first iteration of a naming convention for vars in `Collector`s.
  #1063
- Generally improved readability of Collector code and associated tests (still
  quite some way to go). #1063
- Improved typing for `exploration_noise` and within Collector. #1063
- Better variable names related to model outputs (logits, dist input etc.).
  #1032
- Improved typing for actors and critics, using Tianshou classes
  like `Actor`, `ActorProb`, etc.,
  instead of just `nn.Module`. #1032
- Added interfaces for most `Actor` and `Critic` classes to enforce the presence
  of `forward` methods. #1032
- Simplified `PGPolicy` forward by unifying the `dist_fn` interface (see
  associated breaking change). #1032
- Use `.mode` of distribution instead of relying on knowledge of the
  distribution type. #1032
- Exception no longer raised on `len` of empty `Batch`. #1084
- tests and examples are covered by `mypy`. #1077
- `Actor` is more used, stricter typing by making it generic. #1077
- Use explicit multiprocessing context for creating `Pipe` in `subproc.py`.
  #1102

### Breaking Changes

- `data`:
    - `Collector`:
        - Removed `.data` attribute. #1063
        - Collectors no longer reset the environment on initialization.
          Instead, the user might have to call `reset` expicitly or
          pass `reset_before_collect=True` . #1063
        - Removed `no_grad` argument from `collect` method (was unused in
          tianshou). #1123
    - `Batch`:
        - Fixed `iter(Batch(...)` which now behaves the same way
          as `Batch(...).__iter__()`.
          Can be considered a bugfix. #1063
        - The methods `to_numpy` and `to_torch` in are not in-place anymore
          (use `to_numpy_` or `to_torch_` instead). #1098, #1117
        - The method `Batch.is_empty` has been removed. Instead, the user can
          simply check for emptiness of Batch by using `len` on dicts. #1144
        - Stricter `cat_`, only concatenation of batches with the same structure
          is allowed. #1181
        - `to_torch` and `to_numpy` are no longer static methods.
          So `Batch.to_numpy(batch)` should be replaced by `batch.to_numpy()`.
          #1200
- `utils`:
    - `logger`:
        - `BaseLogger.prepare_dict_for_logging` is now abstract. #1074
        - Removed deprecated and unused `BasicLogger` (only affects users who
          subclassed it). #1074
    - `utils.net`:
        - `Recurrent` now receives and returns
          a `RecurrentStateBatch` instead of a dict. #1077
    - Modules with code that was copied from sensAI have been replaced by
      imports from new dependency sensAI-utils:
        - `tianshou.utils.logging` is replaced with `sensai.util.logging`
        - `tianshou.utils.string` is replaced with `sensai.util.string`
        - `tianshou.utils.pickle` is replaced with `sensai.util.pickle`
- `env`:
    - All VectorEnvs now return a numpy array of info-dicts on reset instead of
      a list. #1063
- `policy`:
    - Changed interface of `dist_fn` in `PGPolicy` and all subclasses to take a
      single argument in both
      continuous and discrete cases. #1032
- `AtariEnvFactory` constructor (in examples, so not really breaking) now
  requires explicit train and test seeds. #1074
- `EnvFactoryRegistered` now requires an explicit `test_seed` in the
  constructor. #1074
- `highlevel`:
    - `params`: The parameter `dist_fn` has been removed from the parameter
      objects (`PGParams`, `A2CParams`, `PPOParams`, `NPGParams`, `TRPOParams`).
      The correct distribution is now determined automatically based on the
      actor factory being used, avoiding the possibility of
      misspecification. Persisted configurations/policies continue to work as
      expected, but code must not specify the `dist_fn` parameter.
      #1194 #1195
    - `env`:
        - `EnvFactoryRegistered`: parameter `seed` has been replaced by the pair
          of parameters `train_seed` and `test_seed`
          Persisted instances will continue to work correctly.
          Subclasses such as `AtariEnvFactory` are also affected requires
          explicit train and test seeds. #1074
        - `VectorEnvType`: `SUBPROC_SHARED_MEM` has been replaced
          by `SUBPROC_SHARED_MEM_DEFAULT`. It is recommended to
          use `SUBPROC_SHARED_MEM_AUTO` instead. However, persisted configs will
          continue working. #1141

### Tests

- Fixed env seeding it `test_sac_with_il.py` so that the test doesn't fail
  randomly. #1081
- Improved CI triggers and added telemetry (if requested by user) #1177
- Improved environment used in tests.
- Improved tests bach equality to check with scalar values #1185

### Dependencies

- [DeepDiff](https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff) added to help with diffs of
  batches in tests. #1098
- Bumped black, idna, pillow
- New extra "eval"
- Bumped numba to >=60.0.0, permitting installation on python 3.12 # 1177
- New dependency sensai-utils

Started after v1.0.0
