We always welcome contributions to help make Tianshou better!
Tianshou was originally created by the `THU-ML Group <https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn>`_ at Tsinghua University.

Today, it is backed by the `appliedAI Institute for Europe <https://www.appliedai-institute.de/en/>`_,
a non-profit organization committed to making Tianshou the go-to resource for reinforcement learning research and development,
guaranteeing its long-term maintenance and support.
