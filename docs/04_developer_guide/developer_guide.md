# Developer Guide

The section addresses developers of Tianshou, providing information for 
both casual contributors and maintainers alike.

## Python Virtual Environment

Tianshou is built and managed by [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). 

The development environment uses Python 3.11.

To install all relevant requirements (as well as Tianshou itself in editable mode)
you can simply call

    poetry install --with dev

```{important}
Depending on your setup, you may need to create and activate an empty virtual environment
using the right Python version beforehand. For instance, to do this with conda, use:

    conda create -n tianshou python=3.11
    conda activate tianshou
```


## Code Style and Auto-Formatting

When editing code in Tianshou, strive for **local consistency**, i.e.
adhere to the style already present in the codebase.

Tianshou uses an auto-formatting for consistency.
To apply it, call

    poe format

To check whether your formatting is compliant without applying the
auto-formatter, call

    poe lint


## Type Checking

We use [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) to perform static type analysis. 
To check typing, run

    poe type-check


## Tests

### Running the Test Suite Locally

Tianshou uses pytest. Tests are located in `./test`.

To run the full set of tests locally, run

    poe test

### Determinism Tests

We implemented **determinism tests** for Tianshou's algorithms, which allow us to determine
whether algorithms still compute exactly the same results even after large refactorings.
These tests are applied by

  1. creating a behavior snapshot in the old code branch before the changes and then
  2. running the respective determinism test in the new branch to ensure that the behavior is the same.

Unfortunately, full determinism is difficult to achieve across different platforms and even different
machines using the same platform an Python environment.
Therefore, these tests are not carried out in the CI pipeline.
Instead, it is up to the developer to run them locally and check the results whenever a change
is made to the codebase that could affect algorithm behavior.

Technically, the two steps are handled by setting static flags in class `AlgorithmDeterminismTest` and then
running either the full test suite or a specific determinism test (`test_*_determinism`, e.g. `test_ddpg_determinism`)
in the two branches to be compared.

  1. On the old branch: (Temporarily) set `ENABLED=True` and `FORCE_SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=True` and run the test(s).
  2. On the new branch: (Temporarily) set `ENABLED=True` and `FORCE_SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=False` and run the test(s).
  3. Inspect the test results; find a summary in `determinism_tests.log`

### Tests in CI (GitHub Actions)

CI tests will extensively test Tianshou's functionality in multiple environments.

In particular, we test
  * on Ubuntu (full functionality tested)
    * **py_pinned**: using the pinned development environment (Python 3.11, known versions of all dependencies)
    * **py_latest**: using a more recent Python version with the newest set of compatible dependencies (automatically resolved)
  * on Windows and macOS (core functionality tested)


#### Principle of Maximum Compatibility

The idea behind testing with dynamically resolved dependencies is that we want to maximize the applicability 
of Tianshou: For important dependencies that could conflict with environments used by our users, **we do not restrict the version of a dependency unless there is a known incompatibility.**

If incompatibilities should arise (e.g. by the "py_latest" test failing), we either 
 * resolve them by making the code compatible with both old and new versions OR
 * add an upper bound to our dependency declarations (excluding the incompatible versions) and release a new 
   version of Tianshou to make these exclusions explicit.

#### Instructions for Users New to GitHub

1. Click the `Actions` button in your own repo:

![Actions button](../_static/images/action1.jpg)

2. Click the green button:

![Enable actions](../_static/images/action2.jpg)

3. You will see `Actions Enabled.` on the top of html page.

4. When you push a new commit to your own repo (e.g. `git push`), it will automatically run the test in this page:

![Actions running](../_static/images/action3.png)

## Documentation

Documentation is in the `docs/` directory, using Markdown (`.md`), ReStructuredText (`.rst`) and notebook files. 
`index.rst` is the main page. 

API References are automatically generated by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) according to the outlines under `docs/api/` and should be modified when any code changes.

To compile documentation into webpage, run

    poe doc-build

The generated webpages can subsequently be found in `docs/_build` and can be viewed with any browser.

### Verifications

We have several automated verification methods for documentation:

1. pydocstyle (as part of ruff): tests all docstring under `tianshou/`;

2. doc8 (as part of ruff): tests ReStructuredText format;

3. sphinx spelling and test: test if there is any error/warning when generating front-end html documentation.

## Creating a Release

To release a new version on PyPI,

 * set the version to be released in `tianshou/__init__.py` and in `pyproject.toml`, creating a commit
 * tag the commit with the version (using the format `v1.2.3`)
 * push the commit (`git push`) and the tag (`git push --tags`)
 * create a new release on GitHub based on the tag; this will trigger the release job for PyPI.

In the past, we provided releases to conda-forge as well,
