**Tianshou** ([天授](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%A9%E6%8E%88)) is a reinforcement learning (RL) library based on pure PyTorch and [Gymnasium](http://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium). Tianshou's main features at a glance are:

1. Modular low-level interfaces for algorithm developers (RL researchers) that are both flexible, hackable and type-safe.
1. Convenient high-level interfaces for applications of RL (training an implemented algorithm on a custom environment).
1. Large scope: online (on- and off-policy) and offline RL, experimental support for multi-agent RL (MARL), experimental support for model-based RL, and more


Unlike other reinforcement learning libraries, which may have complex codebases,
unfriendly high-level APIs, or are not optimized for speed, Tianshou provides a high-performance, modularized framework
and user-friendly interfaces for building deep reinforcement learning agents. One more aspect that sets Tianshou apart is its
generality: it supports online and offline RL, multi-agent RL, and model-based algorithms.

Tianshou aims at enabling concise implementations, both for researchers and practitioners, without sacrificing flexibility.

Other noteworthy features:

- Elegant framework with dual APIs:
  - Tianshou's high-level API maximizes ease of use for application development while still retaining a high degree
    of flexibility.
  - The fundamental procedural API provides a maximum of flexibility for algorithm development without being
    overly verbose.
- State-of-the-art results in [MuJoCo benchmarks](https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou/tree/master/examples/mujoco) for REINFORCE/A2C/TRPO/PPO/DDPG/TD3/SAC algorithms

In Chinese, Tianshou means divinely ordained, being derived to the gift of being born.
Tianshou is a reinforcement learning platform, and the nature of RL is not learn from humans.
So taking "Tianshou" means that there is no teacher to learn from, but rather to learn by oneself through constant interaction with the environment.

“天授”意指上天所授，引申为与生具有的天赋。天授是强化学习平台，而强化学习算法并不是向人类学习的，所以取“天授”意思是没有老师来教，而是自己通过跟环境不断交互来进行学习。

## Installation

Tianshou is currently hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tianshou/) and [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/tianshou-feedstock). It requires Python >= 3.11.

For installing the most recent version of Tianshou, the best way is clone the repository and install it with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
(which you need to install on your system first)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:thu-ml/tianshou.git
cd tianshou
poetry install
```

You can also install the dev requirements by adding `--with dev` or the extras
for say mujoco and acceleration by [envpool](https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool)
by adding `--extras "mujoco envpool"`

If you wish to install multiple extras, ensure that you include them in a single command. Sequential calls to `poetry install --extras xxx` will overwrite prior installations, leaving only the last specified extras installed.
Or you may install all the following extras by adding `--all-extras`.

Available extras are:

- `atari` (for Atari environments)
- `box2d` (for Box2D environments)
- `classic_control` (for classic control (discrete) environments)
- `mujoco` (for MuJoCo environments)
- `mujoco-py` (for legacy mujoco-py environments[^1])
- `pybullet` (for pybullet environments)
- `robotics` (for gymnasium-robotics environments)
- `vizdoom` (for ViZDoom environments)
- `envpool` (for [envpool](https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool/) integration)
- `argparse` (in order to be able to run the high level API examples)

[^1]:
    `mujoco-py` is a legacy package and is not recommended for new projects.
    It is only included for compatibility with older projects.
    Also note that there may be compatibility issues with macOS newer than
    Monterey.

Otherwise, you can install the latest release from PyPI (currently
far behind the master) with the following command:

```bash
$ pip install tianshou
```

If you are using Anaconda or Miniconda, you can install Tianshou from conda-forge:

```bash
$ conda install tianshou -c conda-forge
```

Alternatively to the poetry install, you can also install the latest source version through GitHub:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou.git@master --upgrade
```

Finally, you may check the installation via your Python console as follows:

```python
import tianshou
print(tianshou.__version__)
```

If no errors are reported, you have successfully installed Tianshou.

### Reproducible, High-Quality Results

Tianshou is rigorously tested. In contrast to other RL platforms, **our tests include the full agent training procedure for all of the implemented algorithms**. Our tests would fail once if any of the agents failed to achieve a consistent level of performance on limited epochs.
Our tests thus ensure reproducibility.
Check out the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou/actions) page for more detail.

Atari and MuJoCo benchmark results can be found in the [examples/atari/](examples/atari/) and [examples/mujoco/](examples/mujoco/) folders respectively. **Our MuJoCo results reach or exceed the level of performance of most existing benchmarks.**

### Algorithm Abstraction

Reinforcement learning algorithms are build on abstractions for
  * on-policy algorithms (`OnPolicyAlgorithm`),
  * off-policy algorithms (`OffPolicyAlgorithm`), and
  * offline algorithms (`OfflineAlgorithm`),  

all of which clearly separate the core algorithm from the training process and the respective environment interactions.

In each case, the implementation of an algorithm necessarily involves only the implementation of methods for
  * pre-processing a batch of data, augmenting it with necessary information/sufficient statistics for learning (`_preprocess_batch`),
  * updating model parameters based on an augmented batch of data (`_update_with_batch`). 

The implementation of these methods suffices for a new algorithm to be applicable within Tianshou,
making experimentation with new approaches particularly straightforward.

## Quick Start

Tianshou provides two API levels:

- the high-level interface, which provides ease of use for end users seeking to run deep reinforcement learning applications
- the procedural interface, which provides a maximum of control, especially for very advanced users and developers of reinforcement learning algorithms.

In the following, let us consider an example application using the _CartPole_ gymnasium environment.
We shall apply the deep Q-network (DQN) learning algorithm using both APIs.

### High-Level API

In the high-level API, the basis for an RL experiment is an `ExperimentBuilder`
with which we can build the experiment we then seek to run.
Since we want to use DQN, we use the specialization `DQNExperimentBuilder`.

As imports, we need only the experiment builder itself, the environment factory
and some configuration classes:

```python
from tianshou.highlevel.config import OffPolicyTrainingConfig
from tianshou.highlevel.env import (
    EnvFactoryRegistered,
    VectorEnvType,
)
from tianshou.highlevel.experiment import DQNExperimentBuilder, ExperimentConfig
from tianshou.highlevel.params.algorithm_params import DQNParams
from tianshou.highlevel.trainer import (
    EpochStopCallbackRewardThreshold,
)
```

The high-level API provides largely declarative semantics, i.e. the code is
almost exclusively concerned with configuration that controls what to do
(rather than how to do it).

```python
experiment = (
    DQNExperimentBuilder(
        EnvFactoryRegistered(
            task="CartPole-v1",
            venv_type=VectorEnvType.DUMMY,
            train_seed=0,
            test_seed=10,
        ),
        ExperimentConfig(
            persistence_enabled=False,
            watch=True,
            watch_render=1 / 35,
            watch_num_episodes=100,
        ),
        OffPolicyTrainingConfig(
            num_epochs=10,
            step_per_epoch=10000,
            batch_size=64,
            num_train_envs=10,
            num_test_envs=100,
            buffer_size=20000,
            step_per_collect=10,
            update_per_step=1 / 10,
        ),
    )
    .with_dqn_params(
        DQNParams(
            lr=1e-3,
            discount_factor=0.9,
            n_step_return_horizon=3,
            target_update_freq=320,
            eps_training=0.3,
            eps_inference=0.0,
        ),
    )
    .with_model_factory_default(hidden_sizes=(64, 64))
    .with_epoch_stop_callback(EpochStopCallbackRewardThreshold(195))
    .build()
)
experiment.run()
```

The experiment builder takes three arguments:

- the environment factory for the creation of environments. In this case,
  we use an existing factory implementation for gymnasium environments.
- the experiment configuration, which controls persistence and the overall
  experiment flow. In this case, we have configured that we want to observe
  the agent's behavior after it is trained (`watch=True`) for a number of
  episodes (`watch_num_episodes=100`). We have disabled persistence, because
  we do not want to save training logs, the agent or its configuration for
  future use.
- the training configuration, which controls fundamental training parameters,
  such as the total number of epochs we run the experiment for (`num_epochs=10`)  
  and the number of environment steps each epoch shall consist of
  (`step_per_epoch=10000`).
  Every epoch consists of a series of data collection (rollout) steps and
  training steps.
  The parameter `step_per_collect` controls the amount of data that is
  collected in each collection step and after each collection step, we
  perform a training step, applying a gradient-based update based on a sample
  of data (`batch_size=64`) taken from the buffer of data that has been
  collected. For further details, see the documentation of configuration class.

We then proceed to configure some of the parameters of the DQN algorithm itself
and of the neural network model we want to use.
A DQN-specific detail is the way in which we control the epsilon parameter for 
exploration. 
We want to use random exploration during rollouts for training (`eps_training`), 
but we don't when evaluating the agent's performance in the test environments 
(`eps_inference`).

Find many further applications of the high-level API in the `examples/` folder;
look for scripts ending with `_hl.py`.
Note that most of these examples require the extra package `argparse`
(install it by adding `--extras argparse` when invoking poetry).

### Procedural API

Let us now consider an analogous example in the procedural API.
Find the full script in [examples/discrete/discrete_dqn.py](https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou/blob/master/examples/discrete/discrete_dqn.py).

First, import some relevant packages:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import torch
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
import tianshou as ts
```

Define some hyper-parameters:

```python
task = 'CartPole-v1'
lr, epoch, batch_size = 1e-3, 10, 64
train_num, test_num = 10, 100
gamma, n_step, target_freq = 0.9, 3, 320
buffer_size = 20000
eps_train, eps_test = 0.1, 0.05
step_per_epoch, step_per_collect = 10000, 10
```

Initialize the logger:

```python
logger = ts.utils.TensorboardLogger(SummaryWriter('log/dqn'))
# For other loggers, see https://tianshou.readthedocs.io/en/master/01_tutorials/05_logger.html
```

Make environments:

```python
# You can also try SubprocVectorEnv, which will use parallelization
train_envs = ts.env.DummyVectorEnv([lambda: gym.make(task) for _ in range(train_num)])
test_envs = ts.env.DummyVectorEnv([lambda: gym.make(task) for _ in range(test_num)])
```

Create the network as well as its optimizer:

```python
from tianshou.utils.net.common import Net

# Note: You can easily define other networks.
# See https://tianshou.readthedocs.io/en/master/01_tutorials/00_dqn.html#build-the-network
env = gym.make(task, render_mode="human")
state_shape = env.observation_space.shape or env.observation_space.n
action_shape = env.action_space.shape or env.action_space.n
net = Net(state_shape=state_shape, action_shape=action_shape, hidden_sizes=[128, 128, 128])
optim = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=lr)
```

Set up the policy and collectors:

```python
policy = ts.policy.DQN(
    model=net,
    optim=optim,
    discount_factor=gamma,
    action_space=env.action_space,
    estimation_step=n_step,
    target_update_freq=target_freq
)
train_collector = ts.data.Collector(policy, train_envs,
    ts.data.VectorReplayBuffer(buffer_size, train_num), exploration_noise=True)
test_collector = ts.data.Collector(policy, test_envs,
    exploration_noise=True)  # because DQN uses epsilon-greedy method
```

Let's train it:

```python
result = ts.trainer.OffPolicyTrainer(
  policy=policy,
  train_collector=train_collector,
  test_collector=test_collector,
  max_epoch=epoch,
  step_per_epoch=step_per_epoch,
  step_per_collect=step_per_collect,
  episode_per_test=test_num,
  batch_size=batch_size,
  update_per_step=1 / step_per_collect,
  train_fn=lambda epoch, env_step: policy.set_eps_training(eps_train),
  test_fn=lambda epoch, env_step: policy.set_eps_training(eps_test),
  stop_fn=lambda mean_rewards: mean_rewards >= env.spec.reward_threshold,
  logger=logger,
).run()
print(f"Finished training in {result.timing.total_time} seconds")
```

Save/load the trained policy (it's exactly the same as loading a `torch.nn.module`):

```python
torch.save(policy.state_dict(), 'dqn.pth')
policy.load_state_dict(torch.load('dqn.pth'))
```

Watch the agent with 35 FPS:

```python
policy.eval()
policy.set_eps_training(eps_test)
collector = ts.data.Collector(policy, env, exploration_noise=True)
collector.collect(n_episode=1, render=1 / 35)
```

Inspect the data saved in TensorBoard:

```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir log/dqn
```
