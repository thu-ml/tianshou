    the (maximum) number of epochs to run training for. An **epoch** is the outermost iteration level and each
    epoch consists of a number of training steps and one test step, where each training step

      * [for the online case] collects environment steps/transitions (**collection step**),
        adding them to the (replay) buffer (see :attr:`collection_step_num_env_steps` and :attr:`collection_step_num_episodes`)
      * performs an **update step** via the RL algorithm being used, which can involve
        one or more actual gradient updates, depending on the algorithm

    and the test step collects :attr:`num_episodes_per_test` test episodes in order to evaluate
    agent performance.

    Training may be stopped early if the stop criterion is met (see :attr:`~tianshou.trainer.trainer.TrainerParams.stop_fn`).

    For online training, the number of training steps in each epoch is indirectly determined by
    :attr:`epoch_num_steps`: As many training steps will be performed as are required in
    order to reach :attr:`epoch_num_steps` total steps in the training environments.
    Specifically, if the number of transitions collected per step is `c` (see
    :attr:`collection_step_num_env_steps`) and :attr:`epoch_num_steps` is set to `s`, then the number
    of training steps per epoch is `ceil(s / c)`.
    Therefore, if `max_epochs = e`, the total number of environment steps taken during training
    can be computed as `e * ceil(s / c) * c`.

    For offline training, the number of training steps per epoch is equal to :attr:`epoch_num_steps`.
